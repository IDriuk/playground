// Coin Change
// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations 
// and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. 
// If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
